Because our data on ice is a measure of area, we thought a visualization where size was the most influential visual variable would be the most effective. Radar chartsâ€™ increments in angles lend themselves nicely to visualizing consecutive months in a calendar year. Different chart colors make it easy to distinguish between each year. Originally, we were going to visualize every year from 1992 to 2021 (a whopping 30 graphs!). Our more minimalist final graphs are a lot less cluttered while still communicating the intended message.
